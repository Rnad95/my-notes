> ### The key points that every developer must master

---

* We learned about how we get a good developer mindset using key points when somebody proposes them, often they sound harmless such as:

1. **Conceiving The Purpose of Software**  
2. **The Goals of Software Design**  
3. **(Mis)understanding**  
4. **Simplicity**  
5. **Complexity**  
6. **Maintenance**  
7. **Consistency**

* > The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change. ![the eqyation](https://i.ibb.co/jhL9HS0/Screenshot-from-2022-01-21-16-35-17.png)

9. **Solving Problems**  
10. **Good enough is fine**

> The only times it’s okay to reinvent the wheel is when any of the following are true:  

        - You need something that doesn’t exist yet
        - All of the existing “wheels” are bad technologies or incapable of handling your needs
        - The existing “wheels” aren’t being properly maintained

14. **Resistance**  
15. **Automation**  
16. **Code measurement**  
17. **Productivity**  
18. **Testing**  
19. **(Under)Estimation**  
20. **Running Away From Rewriting**  
21. **Documentation and Commenting**  
22. **Picking Technologies**  
23. **Self-Development**  
24. **Don’t be a hero**  
25. **Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help**  

* **Huseyin Polat Yuruk** who wrote the article said that when you have tried everything, and preferably after you have a working solution, now is the best time to seek advice. Look to peers and senior developers to review your code. He strongly recommends we read Code Simplicity from *` Max Kanat-Alexander `*
